I'm Parthavi Kurugundla, a Computer Science student with a deep passion for Machine Learning and Generative AI. My journey began with a fascination for how intelligent systems work, and over time, it has evolved into a hands-on exploration of building real-world applications that solve meaningful problems.

From developing cold-start recommendation systems using meta-learning and clustering, to creating summarization bots and facial expression recognition tools, my work is driven by a desire to blend deep technical knowledge with practical usability. During my internship at Virtusa Capital, I worked on applying LLMs to summarization tasks, which further reinforced my interest in natural language processing and applied AI.

I worked on structuring backend systems using Express.js, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL — particularly for a student-faculty project allocation platform, aimed at streamlining academic collaboration.

What motivates me most is the idea of using AI and software to simplify complex processes and make impactful tools more accessible. I enjoy working at the intersection of innovation and empathy — where technology not only functions efficiently but also resonates with real user needs.

Whether it’s building intelligent tools for education, experimenting with deep learning models, or exploring new techniques in recommendation systems, I strive to create solutions that are thoughtful, scalable, and future-ready.
